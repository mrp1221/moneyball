# Moneyball
IMPORTANT NOTE -- Github struggles to display .ipynb files, especially ones with visualizations, and Google Colab was not much better. This project heavily features Matplotlib graph visualizations, so I have included a PDF of the entire notebook. It may take a minute or two to load everything when it is opened within Github, but everything will be visible and legible in the PDF.

This is one of my first Data Science projects that I did. It analyzes data regarding MLB teams over a 25-year period. The data it uses is stored in a sqlite file (provided here in a zip file, because it is too large for Github). It seeks to analyze a reliable metric for the efficiency of teams, determined with proportional analyses of each team's win percentage and standardized payroll over time.
