This is one of my first Data Science projects that I did. It analyzes data regarding MLB teams over a 25-year period. The data it uses is stored in a sqlite file (provided here in a zip file, because it is too large for Github). It seeks to analyze a reliable metric for the efficiency of teams, determined with proportional analyses of each team's win percentage and standardized payroll over time.
